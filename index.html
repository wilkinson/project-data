    <h1>Using QMachine to Analyze Multiple Prokaryote Genomes</h1>
    <div>
      In this experiment we will look for the longest similar segment in the
      fourteen <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> strains for which full genomes
      are available on
      <a href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria/">NCBI's FTP site</a>
      as of April 30, 2012. A webcast is available on
      <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDtOMd2KRTc">YouTube</a>.
    </div>
    <div>
      The first step is to make QMachine's JavaScript library available. To
      include it directly within a webpage, as we have done here, add the
      following snippet to your HTML:
    </div>
    <div class="inline-code">
      &lt;script src="http://qmachine.org/q.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    </div>
    <div>
      You can also import it dynamically from within an existing JavaScript
      program by inserting these lines:
    </div>
    <div class="inline-code">
      s = document.createElement('script');
      s.src = 'http://qmachine.org/q.js';
      document.body.appendChild(s);
    </div>
    <div>
      In this illustration we will distribute the MapReduce decomposition of
      sequence alignment described in (Almeida 2012),
      <a href="http://usm.github.com">http://usm.github.com</a>. In that
      report, the genome of one of those strains, R6, is probed for the longest
      similar segment to "TCCACAGCATGCGTGACGATGACACG",
    </div>
    <div class="inline-code">
      uBac = new usm('ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria/Streptococ\
        cus_pneumoniae_R6_uid57859/NC_003098.fna');
      A = uBac.align('TCCACAGCATGCGTGACGATGACACG');
    </div>
    <div>
      and three different segments of ten units each are found. Here, the
      fourteen genomes, each approximately two million base pairs long, are
      also made available as JavaScript function calls at
      <a href="Pneumo">http://q.cgr.googlecode.com/hg/Pneumo</a>. An
      abbreviated form of the
      <a href="Pneumo/NC_003098.fna.js">
        <span class="inline-code">fasta</span> call for R6</a> follows:
    </div>
    <div class="inline-code">
      fasta({
          name:"NC_003098.fna",
          head:">gi|15902044|ref|NC_003098.1| Streptococcus pneumoniae R6, c\
            omplete genome",
          body:"TTGAAAGAAAAACAATTTTGGAATCGTATATTAGAA...TATTAAACTTTTAAATAGTAA\
            AGGAGGAGAAAGGA"
      });
    </div>
    <div>
      The <a class="inline-code" href="fasta.js">fasta</a> function definition
      is deceptively simple -- it's just a reference to QM's built-in
      <a class="inline-code" href="http://qmachine.org/q.js">capture</a>
      function, which itself only "captures" incoming data into a private state
      variable where QM can find it again later. Here are the two definitions,
      excerpted from their respective source files:
    <!--
      ... which accepts a URI reference as its input argument and which
      returns an "asynchronous variable" ("avar"). Essentially, an avar is a
      JavaScript object with a "key" property for identification and a "val"
      property for data storage. As detailed in the QM manuscript, an avar is a
      high-level container for arbitrary data along with the sequence of
      transformations yet to be applied to that data.
    -->
    <!--
      As detailed in the QM manuscript, an avar is a logical extension of
      well-known JavaScript idioms into the domain of high-performance
      computing, where event-driven, functional approaches are uncommon.
    -->
    <!--
      whose value will contain the results
      of the alignment  computation may be distributed by QM for
      execution by other web browsers in parallel where this sequence matching
      will be made for each of the fourteen genomes and the results returned
      back to the invoking machine:
    -->
    </div>
    <div class="inline-code">
      capture = function (data) {
       // This function "captures" incoming data by saving a reference to it
       // in `state.shelf`. It is quite useful when combined with JSONP :-)
          state.shelf.push(data);
          return avar().revive();
      };

      global.fasta = Q.capture;
    </div>
    <div>
      It may seem incomplete to present the definitions without their original
      surrounding contexts, but doing so highlights the subtleties involved in
      the problem itself and thereby explains our solution's design.
    </div>
    <div>
      <span style="color:red">(placeholder segue)</span> For example, for the
      R6 strain we can use this invocation:
    </div>
    <div class="inline-code">
      Q.fasta('http://q.cgr.googlecode.com/hg/Pneumo/NC_003098.fna.js');
    </div>
    <div>
      This will take a few seconds -- just wait for the console to display
      "done!". The final result is stored in
      <span class="inline-code">fasta.A</span>, which contains
      the position or positions of the longest shared segments and looks
      something like
    </div>
    <div class="inline-code">
      fasta.A
	Object
	ind: 1
	match: Array[4]
	0: 0
	1: 10
	2: 10
	3: 10
	length: 4
	__proto__: Array[0]
	posBase: Array[4]
	0: 0
	1: 1811967
	2: 1895547
	3: 1992091
	length: 4
	__proto__: Array[0]
	posProbe: Array[4]
	0: 0
	1: 5
	2: 0
	3: 14
	length: 4
	__proto__: Array[0]
	__proto__: Object
    </div>
    <div>
      As detailed in the USM paper, the longest shared segment has length 10,
      and 10 different segments of that length were found in R6's genome. Now,
      for the grand finale, let's compute the the alignment results for each
      of the 14 pneumococcal genomes simultaneously by using QM to distribute
      individual tasks to volunteer web browsers. As detailed in the QM
      manuscript, this strategy not only distributes the computational load,
      but it also distributes the bandwidth requirements, too.

      <button onclick="Q.lib('./daemon.js')">Volunteer for QM</button>
    </div>
    <div>
      Note also that, thanks to the use of the
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/">Cross-Origin Resource Sharing</a>
      standard that is available in modern web browsers, you can construct
      simple web pages to send to others so that, by simple opening the page,
      they can volunteer their computers' resources to help run your jobs.
